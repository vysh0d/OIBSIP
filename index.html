  <h2>BTS as a Safe Space</h2>

  <p>
    During a time when the world felt uncertain and isolating, especially
    throughout the COVID pandemic, many people were forced to slow down and
    sit with emotions they had never faced before. In those moments, BTS did
    not try to dismiss the fear or pretend that everything was normal. Instead,
    they acknowledged it — openly and honestly.
  </p>

  <p>
    When BTS spoke at the United Nations, their message was not about success
    or perfection, but about listening to yourself, accepting fear, and moving
    forward at your own pace. Their words resonated with millions of people
    because they reflected shared human experiences rather than distant ideals.
  </p>

  <p>
    BTS became a safe space because they made people feel seen. Through their
    music, speeches, and actions, they reminded listeners that it was okay to
    feel lost, to feel tired, and to take life one step at a time. That sense
    of understanding is what made their presence comforting to so many —
    including me.

  <h2>Lyrics That Felt Like Home</h2>

  <p>
    What made me admire BTS deeply was not just their music, but the way their
    lyrics spoke about things people often struggle to say out loud. Their
    songs never felt like they were telling listeners to be strong all the
    time — instead, they acknowledged fear, self-doubt, exhaustion, and the
    quiet moments of uncertainty that many people carry.
  </p>

  <p>
    They spoke openly about ideas that felt comforting yet rarely voiced —
    that it is okay to not be okay, that it is okay to not have a dream, and
    that life does not have to follow a timeline set by society. Their words
    gently reminded listeners that happiness does not come from meeting
    expectations, but from doing what feels right for yourself, because in
    the end, you are the one who has to live with your choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    During a time when I was mentally struggling, one of their songs,
    <a href="https://youtu.be/jzHtHAg2igc?si=mwFUoW51bppEXmAh" 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   class="song-link">
  <em>Telepathy</em>
</a>
, felt especially comforting. It carried a warmth that
    felt like someone reaching out and saying they cared, even from a
    distance. The song did not try to solve anything — it simply stayed,
    and that presence meant more than advice ever could.
  </p>

  <p>
    I admire BTS because their lyrics feel honest rather than perfect. They
    don’t promise that everything will be okay, but they remind people that
    they are not alone in how they feel. There is this quote by <b>Jungkook</b> the youngest member of the group that says, 
    <b>“Effort makes you. You will regret someday if you don’t do your best now. Don’t think it’s too late but keep working on it. 
    It takes time, but there’s nothing that gets worse due to practicing. So practice. You may get depressed, but it’s evidence that you are doing good.”</b> 
    these words has given me strength and courage to do without thinking about the outcome but to focus on giving my everything and trying.
    Over time, those words began to feel like home — a place to return to whenever things felt overwhelming.

<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Messages That Stayed</h2>

  <p>
    Some words stayed with me long after the songs ended.
  </p>

  <p>
    That it’s okay to move slowly.  
    That it’s okay to rest without guilt.
  </p>

  <p>
    That not having everything figured out doesn’t mean you’re failing.
  </p>

  <p>
    That choosing yourself, even quietly, is still choosing yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    And sometimes, just knowing someone understands is enough.
