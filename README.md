## Objective
The objective of this task was to design and develop a tribute webpage for a person or group I admire, using basic web technologies while focusing on layout, design, and user experience.

## Task Description
As part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development & Design Internship (Level 2 – Task 2), I created a tribute webpage dedicated to BTS. The page highlights their impact through written content, quotes, images, and interactive elements.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Styled the webpage using CSS with focus on spacing, readability, and theme
- Added interactivity using JavaScript (reassurance button and ARMY quotes slider)
- Organized assets using folders
- Hosted the project using GitHub Pages

## Outcome
This project helped me improve my understanding of front-end development, design consistency, and project structuring. It also enhanced my confidence in building and hosting complete web projects independently.
